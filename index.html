      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Currently in a System Engineer position at Samsung Austin Semiconductor (SAS) since November 2019, highly excited for the knowledge and experience to come.
        Before that, I was part of the Process Integration team also at SAS, dealing with introduction of state-of-the-art <strong>CIS</strong> (CMOS Image Sensor) products and the manufacturing readiness. I have been with SAS for 5 years now, and not much longer than that living in the US. I graduated in 2012 as Automation Engineer at the CUJAE in Havana, Cuba.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Cuba.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>PC Gaming, working on my car and (recently) photography</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to either:</p>,
      <ul>
        <li>be part of a highly capable and proficient team of web developers;</li>
        <li>be a good data scientist;</li>
        <li>or have my own performance and custom tuning car shop.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(yes I believe people can have more than one dream job :)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I now live in Pflugerville, TX.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have had previous exposure to Web work and I enjoyed all of it, but never had the opportunity to take it to the level of efficiency, professionalism and elegance I wanted. Now that I have been able to find a job which requires me to do so, it is the time to invest on improving my skills, incorporate fresh and updated knowledge and gain experience that will help me to reach that point. </p>
